This fork of **TizenTube Cobalt** keeps the TizenTube experience while adding a fail-closed account allowlist: **a video is available only when the signed-in YouTube account supplies trustworthy account-library proof for it**. That includes liked videos, videos from subscribed channels, videos in account-owned playlists, supported YouTube Music library/artist-album collections, and explicitly owned purchased titles.

The restriction is applied at document start and filters YouTube discovery/playback responses used by search results, home/recommendation shelves, related and post-playback suggestions, queues/autoplay, and player responses. The allowlist is rebuilt from signed-in account data, so supported library changes made on other devices are picked up from the same account. Signed-out/guest mode remains fail-closed.

> This is an independent fork. The upstream project is [reisxd/TizenTubeCobalt](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenTubeCobalt).

## Download the allowed-only build

**Current release: [TizenTube Liked + Subscriptions v3 (hardened rebuild)](https://github.com/YossiMH/TizenTubeCobalt/releases/tag/allowed-only-v3-rebuild)**

Choose the APK for your device:

- **ARM64 / `arm64-v8a` (most modern Android TV / Google TV devices):** [TizenTube-Liked-Subs-arm64.apk](https://github.com/YossiMH/TizenTubeCobalt/releases/download/allowed-only-v3-rebuild/TizenTube-Liked-Subs-arm64.apk)
- **32-bit ARM / `armeabi-v7a` (older devices):** [TizenTube-Liked-Subs-arm.apk](https://github.com/YossiMH/TizenTubeCobalt/releases/download/allowed-only-v3-rebuild/TizenTube-Liked-Subs-arm.apk)
- [SHA-256 checksums](https://github.com/YossiMH/TizenTubeCobalt/releases/download/allowed-only-v3-rebuild/SHA256SUMS.txt)

The fork APK uses package ID `io.gh.yossim.tizentube.cobalt`, so it can be installed beside upstream TizenTube Cobalt rather than replacing it.

## Updates

Every release from v2 onward is signed with the same permanent key, so a future release can be installed directly over the previous one (no need to uninstall first). The release pipeline refuses to build an installer with a temporary signing key, because that would silently break future updates for everyone who installed it.

One-time note: the first release (v1) was signed with a one-time key that no longer exists. If you installed v1 and now install v2 or v3, Android may ask you to uninstall the old app first. That is a one-time step; from v2 onward, future releases update in place.

## What "allowed only" means

A video passes the filter only when one of these trusted account relationships is proven:

1. Its video ID is present in the signed-in account's **Liked videos** list.
2. Its channel ID is present in the signed-in account's **subscriptions**.
3. Its video ID was discovered inside an **account-owned playlist**.
4. Its video ID was discovered through the supported **YouTube Music account-library / artist-album collection** paths.
5. It is explicitly marked as **purchased/owned** by the signed-in account on the trusted purchase-library path.

Everything else is removed from video-bearing discovery responses. A disallowed direct/player response has its streaming data removed and is returned as unavailable instead of being allowed to play. Account-library extraction is provenance-sensitive: an orphan video ID or a lookalike response is not enough to authorize playback.

The filter covers the YouTube internal API surfaces used for browse/home feeds, search, next/related/autoplay, player responses, reels, notification inbox items, and queue responses, plus a DOM safety sweep for post-playback suggestions that can be inserted after the API response. Non-video UI such as search text suggestions is not intentionally removed.

**Signed out or guest mode is fully blocked.** The allowed list comes only from trustworthy signed-in account data, so when no account is signed in every video is removed from home/search/related/post-playback surfaces and every player response is returned as unavailable. Nothing is watchable until the account relationship needed by the allowlist is proven.

## Verification included in this fork

- Permanent JavaScript tests cover liked/subscribed and account-library authorization, disallowed/player blocking, post-playback suggestion filtering, guest fail-closed behavior, Ad Blocker payload sanitization, SponsorBlock segment handling, DeArrow title/thumbnail behavior, playback-speed controls, boot recovery, visible status, and loader double-load protection.
- APK patcher tests verify dex integrity, Trusted-Types-safe document-start loading, same-length native CDN pinning, disabled Evergreen update endpoints, and release verification.
- The release builder verifies the exact upstream APK hashes before patching.
- Produced APKs are zip-aligned, signed with the persistent update key, checked for the fork package ID/label, and checked to contain the document-start loader pinned to the exact source commit used for the build.

## TizenTube features

The APK's single document-start script slot loads one combined fork runtime. The allow-only/media guard and TizenTube extras therefore do not compete by wrapping the same network APIs twice.

The combined runtime restores these controls while keeping allow-only enforcement non-disableable:

- **Ad Blocker** — enabled by default; strips YouTube ad placement/player-ad fields and ad-only cards.
- **SponsorBlock** — enabled by default; automatically skips the supported SponsorBlock categories, with per-category on/off controls.
- **DeArrow** — enabled by default; applies community titles and thumbnails to matching allowed videos when branding is available.
- **Playback speed** — 0.25× through 5× in 0.25× steps, plus the upstream 1.0001× stutter workaround.

To open the controls with an ordinary TV remote, enter **YouTube TV Settings**. TizenSub+ automatically opens its TizenTube Settings overlay there. Use Up/Down and Select to change toggles, Left/Right on playback speed, and Back to return to YouTube Settings. Colored-key shortcuts remain optional rather than required.

## TV setup and phone remote control

- Install the APK from the download section above (ARM64 for modern boxes like the Onn 4K; ARM for older devices).
- On the box, one-time step: enable Developer options (Settings > About > tap Build 7 times), enable USB/network debugging, and allow this PC when it asks.
- Optional: run the included setup script to disable dedicated unrestricted YouTube clients on the box (stock YouTube, SmartTube, upstream TizenTube, and similar clients) without changing the OS or launcher. General-purpose browsers and file explorers, including AnExplorer, are deliberately preserved as usable tools and are not part of the dedicated-client lockdown. Because those apps can browse arbitrary web sites, TizenSub+ cannot enforce its allowlist inside them; child containment therefore requires profile/app-access controls rather than disabling the tools for everyone. It picks the right app build automatically (ARM64 for modern boxes like the Onn 4K Pro, 32-bit ARM for older devices):

```powershell
pwsh tools/onn_setup.ps1 -Serial 192.168.1.172:5555
```

- The setup script refuses to install anything but the verified guarded
  build, cold-starts the app, and confirms from the device log that the
  guardian reached boot-ready. If startup hits a network-error screen, it uses
  a bounded wake-display-and-restart recovery because Android TV can block an
  idle app's network through Doze even while Wi-Fi remains healthy. Recovery
  fails setup instead of warning-only success. Re-run it anytime with
  `-VerifyApp` to re-assert the lock-down and re-check the guardian, e.g. after
  the box's Google account re-verifies.

- Sign in on the TV with the Google account whose Likes/subscriptions define the allowed catalog. Signed-out/guest mode shows nothing, by design.
- Phone remote control: open the YouTube app on your phone, tap the cast/remote icon, and pair with this TV (standard YouTube TV pairing). Pairing passes through the filter untouched; only disallowed playback is blocked, so phone control of the TV works while the TV still refuses to play anything outside the allowed list.

## Install and sign in

1. Download the correct APK above.
2. Sideload/install it on the Android TV / Google TV device.
3. Launch **TizenSub+**.
4. Sign into the same YouTube account whose Likes and subscriptions should define the allowed catalog.
5. Reload/relaunch the app after making account changes elsewhere when you want to force a fresh allowlist sync immediately.
